MY FIRST PROJECT (Sports project)
Of course each and every player or athlete must go through some injury phase in his or her life. I George is very invested in sports and wants to see players in the African region succeed in their sports journey. This project is aimed at helping player with their coaches and the organisation at large have an easy time handling the injury phase and the injury in it self so that the player together with the coach and even organisation find easy time in recovery.
The app website will work in a way that sport doctors will be put in a data base in terms of region so that different players in the different regions may have an easy time accessing help from the best and most qualified doctors available.
